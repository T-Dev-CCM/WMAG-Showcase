# Major Antagonists 

> The Super Important Big Bads of the Game


## Parallax The Hateful (Image Coming Soon!) 

- Summoned from a group of Dark Magicians, he was originally planned to be used as a tool for the people who created him. However, he fought back, and killed the dark magicians who created him, and now he has a vendetta against humanity and wishes to take over society for the purpose of a new world order under his command


## Mevia/Mev.IA (Image Coming Soon!) 

- A character originally planned for an in-game update, the developers couldn't find a way to make her balanced for the launch date, so they had to trash her completely. Sitting in the trash can, she grew more corrupted with each day and her insanity only grew with it, and she escaped back to the game files and corrupted the game's world. Her endgoal is to create a perfect world with her creator...by resetting everything. 


## Jason Wolfe 

- Head of the Organization of the Dying Star, Jason Wolfe has been remouned as one of the most respected, feared, peak performance, and most dangerous human alive. He views the world as a bunch of cruel people who must be destroyed, while the good portion are saved. He has no hesitation to kill anyone that dares step in his way and makes no negotiations, and will stop at nothing for destroying 99.999% of life on earth
