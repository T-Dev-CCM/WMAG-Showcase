## The World of Erely 

- The world of our game! 


- Our game takes place in the world of Erely, a nation full of unique areas to explore, people to help and places to discover. You will travel to nations far and wide, so let's take a look at where you'll go! 



## Swordbreak 

- Home of game developers Alex and Trey, Swordbreak is your regular quiet town with grassy meadows and friendly locals, enemies are common however, so be on the lookout 

## Cleveland 

- This city has all sorts of interesting people, places, and other things...for better or worse. The city is relatively dangerous with the amount of shady people running around and a general lack of common sense. 

## Infernal Expanse

- This vast desert isn't typically one would be willing to explore with all the snakes, sand creatures, and sun worshipers on patrol, however while roaming you could find yourself in Sunset Bazaar, a modern day take on a traditional bazaar accomodating to all necessities in the modern era while still maintaining old traditionns (wifi, technology, all that jazz) 

## Ramshorn 

- You might not expect much from a simple sewer entrance, but investigate further and you'll enter Ramshorn, the not-so lucrative sewer post apocalyptic themed fight club. Here, the only rules are no eye poking and no punching in the groin, otheriwse, the fierce fighters that compete in the ring will hold nothing back in order to achieve victory. 

## Shivervale Hotel 

- The Shivervale area might not hold much, but go further into the blizzard, and you'll stumble upon Shivervale Snowtel, the only winter themed suite that values the guest over anything else. Inside is a sizeable amount of rooms, angry staff, and other odd things waiting for you to check in 

## Tubulartopia 

- We're uncertain how we got here, but this town loved the 90s so much, they decided to stick with it decades later! Modern technology is practically unheard of here, and everyone has the latest retro game cosole, walkman, and loads of neon clothing to spare. 

## Darkwell 

- Domain of Parallax the Hateful, not much exists down in this gloomy cave other than enemies, and the stone platforms that emerge from the void below. 

## Supreme City 

- Not much is known about Supreme City yet, so stay tuned for further research!
