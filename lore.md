# Clyde  

- Clyde was born in Cleveland, and seconds after being born, his parents left the hospital and never returned, leaving Clyde there. Clyde however didn't seem to care, and he was sent to an orphanage. Clyde got into frequent trouble at the orphanage for his aggressive tendencies, threatening and injuring other kids, and was promptly removed from the orphanage to live for himself. Clyde again didn't particularly care that much, and stayed in the alleys of Cleveland living off of anything that he could find. The only contact he made with other people was threatening them or calling them names, so he had no friends growing up, except for when he met the Substance Rat, who he respects. And that's been his life for several years, until 2 game developers happened to wander in his alley...

# Collector 

- Collector was raised in the Infernal Expanse when they were young, and always had a habit for collecting things. Sand from different areas, rocks, bottles, anything. As they grew older, they grew interested in magic and began to study it whenever they could. As Collector grew more proficient with their magic, the people of the Bazaar noticed that the shadow creature would push back foes and could entertain a crying child. So, they decided to put Collector as an entertainer for their Bazaar, and they used their magic to entertain and astonish those who watched. Then one night, a wandering magician from a birthday party stumbled into the Bazaar and was quick to flaunt his slight of hand magic, much to the amazement of the people living there. After not being scheduled for entertainment for several days, Collector then felt redundant due to their spells and effort-pulled magic replaced by someone's slight of hand. As a result, they left the Bazaar and constructed a house in the middle of the desert, where they started a new hobby of collecting figures. They lost a majority of their magic skills over time, and nobody has heard from them since

# Mevia  

- Upon the success of the game Trey and Alex were working on, it was only fair that they make an update with new content for their players around Halloween. Among many ideas, one was the idea for a new character to be introduced. This character was Mevia, a super happy-go-lucky girl with an adorable personality, love for anything and everything and was super overpowered with her damage dealing moveset. Trey poured a lot of heart and soul into her, and the now sentient Mevia grew really fond of the person who created her. However, she was still overpowered and any nerfs would make her significantly redundant. With the constant inbalance between overpowered and unviablility, and the update's launch releasing in 1 week, Mevia had to be scrapped, and in tears, Trey put her in the trash. Mevia was crushed by the fact she was discarded and loathed herself for while she sat in the trash. days went by, and Mevia's code began to corrupt from the time spent in the trash, and in doing so corrupted her. She also grew mentally unstable, obsessing over wanting to be perfect for her creator. She wanted to be with him, and she wanted to be perfect, and she was going to do that very thing. When Trey threw out more files before the day's launch, she used that to escape back into the game files and wait until launch day to corrupt and ruin all of the update and inserting herself in the game to reset the world. Just to be in the perfect world with the person who created her

# Jason Wolfe 

- Jason was the son of Sanford and Janet Wolfe, and by the time he reached the age of 8, his physical strength and agility were surprisingly strong for someone his age. Wishing to pursue a career in this field, he was enlisted into a classified training center that pushed their students to their physical limits. Jason fought harder than ever before, and rose to the top performer in the academy. He had friends, trainers, and parents who were really proud of him, Then one day, his parents contracted a life-threatening illness. Not having any relatives, Jason tried to tell his trainers, asking if they could do something. They said no. He asked his peers, they refused. Young Jason then turned to people passing on the street for help. He was always met with refusal. As a result, Sanford and Janet Wolfe passed away, with Jason not being able to say goodbye. He mourned this immense loss for days and was never able to recover from it. from that day forward, he saw the world as a heartless planet with inhabitants just as cruel that deserved to be destroyed. Years later, he keeps himself as physically fit as possible, and started the Organization of the Dying Star, to show the world his pain for what he had lost because of them. All of them
