## Game Mechanics 

- How our game will work!


- Our game is a turn base rpg with the element of grid based combat. when in battle, the characters will enter a grid based battlefield which they can move about on and perform attacks and abilities. This way, the player can strategize on what abilities will hit certain characters or hitting multiple enemies with one move. This added element of strategy allows for the player to develop their own strategies and meneuvers to best optimize the characters' survival. 

- An example of how this will look is demonstrated in the image below
